# ZeptoNow Smart Price Sorter üõí

## Why?

Zepto is great for quick grocery delivery, but as of now, it **doesn't have a sort button** for products. If you're like me and want to buy your groceries at the **minimum possible amount** (while also considering the max stock available), this can be a pain.

So, I made this script! It sorts Zepto products by price, making it way easier to spot the best deals and stock up smartly. I put this together in about half an hour‚Äîhonestly, it's something Zepto could've built themselves, but hey, maybe there's a reason they haven't yet. Until then, this is for all the price-conscious shoppers out there! 
Simple client-side patch for missing functionality.

## What does it do?
- Adds a draggable, Zepto-themed sort button to the site
- Sorts products by price (ascending/descending)
- Spinner shows inside the button while sorting
- Works automatically as new products load

## How to use
1. Install a userscript manager like Tampermonkey.
2. Add the script below.
3. Go to [ZeptoNow](https://www.zeptonow.com/) and enjoy easy sorting!
